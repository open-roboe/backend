# development guide

There are two main areas of development:

- The server, which is written in python and is responsible for the APIs used by the android app and the web admin interface

- The web app, a small admin interface written in javascript

Your contribution on any of those areas is always welcome!
Check out one of the following guides to get started

- [server development](./server-development.md)
- [web app development](./web-app-development.md)
